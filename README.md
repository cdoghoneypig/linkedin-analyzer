# linkedin-analyzer
Takes search results from LinkedIn and analyzes jobs before a school vs after.

The initial version of this analyzes results for UXDI students. I have also gathered LinkedIn data on GA's WDI and for HackReactor.

The scripts to run are:
linkedin-results-scraper1.py
to build json files from html files then
analyze1.py
to analyze the json files and output .xls files
